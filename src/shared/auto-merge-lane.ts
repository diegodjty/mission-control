/**
 * Auto-merge lane decision (PURE — the walking skeleton) — issue 145, ADR-0021
 * (merge-as-you-go), PRD "Headless drain lane + merge-as-you-go" stories 13 & 19.
 *
 * ADR-0021 replaces press-time merging with an **always-on, per-repo auto-merge
 * lane**: on every Run-finish (and every merge completion) Mission Control sweeps
 * a repo's finished-unmerged, **Receipt-backed** `afk/` branches in finish order
 * and merges the next one that the preview stamps clean against the CURRENT main
 * tip — provided main is idle. A clean auto-merge is silent + a passive note
 * (ADR-0011/0012 noise floor); it never blocks and never becomes a chat message.
 *
 * This module is the lane's pure BRAIN. Given the finished-unmerged candidates
 * (each annotated with whether a Receipt backs it, its Receipt `finished`
 * timestamp, and its merge-preview verdict) plus the three main-idle facts, it
 * decides ONE thing: merge the next clean branch, or hold (and why). The
 * `afk-merge.sh` executor and the per-repo serializer live in the main-process
 * `auto-merge-lane-executor`; this decision is PURE (no git, no fs, no Electron)
 * so the whole merge-or-hold matrix is unit-testable in isolation (see the PRD
 * "Testing Decisions").
 *
 * Scope (issues 145 → 146). Issue 145's walking skeleton merged at most one clean
 * branch per sweep and treated every non-`clean` verdict as a hold. **Issue 146
 * completes the lane doctrine** on top of that seed: the decision now WALKS the
 * receipt-backed candidates in finish order and distinguishes the non-clean cases
 * the skeleton lumped together —
 *   - a predicted **conflict** (`conflicts`/`blocked`) → `pause`: the lane raises
 *     a blocking approval on that branch and merges NOTHING past it in finish
 *     order (later clean branches queue). Runs keep executing — the pause is a
 *     merge-lane fact, not a Run fact — and it clears itself the moment the
 *     conflicting branch leaves the candidate set (resolved or aborted), so
 *     "resume" needs no stored flag: the next sweep simply re-derives.
 *   - an artifact-hygiene **offender** (`artifact`, issue 98/106) → skipped
 *     PER-OFFENDER while the walk continues, so an innocent clean sibling later in
 *     finish order still merges. The skipped offenders ride the decision so the
 *     executor can raise their per-branch attention items.
 *   - a **stray** (no Receipt) is filtered out of the walk entirely — never
 *     auto-merged, never a blocker (ADR-0021: the human adopts it by hand).
 * Still one merge per sweep (the next sweep, fired on the merge completion, takes
 * the following branch); still PURE (no git/fs/Electron) so the whole
 * merge / pause / skip / hold matrix is unit-testable in isolation.
